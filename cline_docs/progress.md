# Progress Status

## What Works (Completed Tasks from `implementation-plan.md` Section 8.1)
*   Initial WebRTC audio integration (though architecture shifted).
*   Client-side audio capture and processing (16kHz mono, noise reduction via Krisp).
*   Basic audio proxy server configuration (LiveKit proxy, though needs updates for POST/SSE).
*   Basic Replicate API integration setup.
*   Voice assistant UI components and visualization (linked to audio levels).
*   CORS configuration basics.
*   Basic participant tracking/session management.
*   Audio parameter optimization.
*   **Core communication shift:**
    *   Server-Sent Events (SSE) initial implementation for streaming responses (client/server).
    *   HTTP POST initial implementation for audio data transmission (client/server).
    *   Chunked audio transmission with sequence tracking.
*   Basic error handling and retry logic.
*   ES Module compatibility fixes in LiveKit proxy.

## What's Left to Build / In Progress (Based on `implementation-plan.md` Sections 8.2 & 8.3)

**Currently In Progress / High Priority Issues:**

1.  **Fixing Shopify App Proxy + SSE/POST Communication (CRITICAL):**
    *   The core SSE/POST communication flow through `/apps/voice` is not working reliably.
    *   Debugging path handling, URL formation, CORS, headers, and session correlation across client, proxy, and backend.
    *   Requires updates to `livekit-proxy.server.js`, `voice-assistant-integration.js`, and potentially Remix routes.
    *   Needs enhanced logging/diagnostics.
2.  **Enhancing Error Handling & Recovery:**
    *   Making error messages more user-friendly.
    *   Implementing robust fallback mechanisms for connection failures.
    *   Improving reconnection logic (backoff, state management).
    *   Fixing potential race conditions/duplicate listeners in frontend event handling.
3.  **Testing & Debugging SSE/POST Flow:**
    *   Thorough testing under various network conditions.
    *   End-to-end testing via the Shopify proxy.
    *   Verifying reconnection behavior.
4.  **Streaming Response Processing:**
    *   Testing the parsing and progressive UI updates with actual streaming responses from the Ultravox API via the full SSE pipeline.

**Next Major Features (Pending resolution of critical issues):**

5.  **Tool Calling Framework Implementation:**
    *   Defining JSON schemas for tools (product search, UI display, navigation).
    *   Implementing the execution engine in the backend.
    *   Integrating with Shopify Storefront API for product search.
    *   Creating frontend components to display tool results.
6.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Implementation:**
    *   Integrating Web Speech API (or fallback) for voice responses.
    *   Adding playback controls and UI feedback.

**Lower Priority / Future Work:**

*   Production preparation (monitoring, logging, deployment procedures, SSL).
*   Comprehensive testing across browsers/devices.
*   Advanced features (multi-turn conversations, checkout assistance, analytics dashboard, multi-language support).
*   Further latency optimization.
*   Updating documentation (`system-architecture.md`) to reflect POST/SSE changes.
