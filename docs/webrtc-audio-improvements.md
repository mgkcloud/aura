# WebRTC Audio Improvements for Voice Assistant

This document outlines the improvements made to the voice assistant's audio processing using WebRTC and LiveKit.

## Overview

We have enhanced the voice assistant's audio processing capabilities by implementing a robust WebRTC audio pipeline using LiveKit. The improvements focus on audio quality, noise reduction, and proper audio level monitoring for voice recognition applications.

## Key Improvements

1. **Advanced Audio Processing**
   - Improved noise cancellation using Krisp.ai integration
   - Better echo cancellation with optimized WebRTC audio parameters
   - Customizable microphone gain control for clearer voice capture

2. **Optimized Audio Parameters for Voice Recognition**
   - 16kHz mono audio sampling (optimal for speech recognition)
   - Proper audio preprocessing for voice clarity
   - Configurable audio settings to balance quality and bandwidth

3. **Robust Audio Visualization**
   - Real-time frequency analysis for responsive visualization
   - Accurate volume level monitoring
   - Integration with existing visualization design

4. **Better Resource Management**
   - Proper media track cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Efficient audio buffer handling to reduce latency
   - Graceful error recovery with fallback mechanisms

5. **Improved Connection Handling**
   - More reliable WebRTC connections
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Better error handling and diagnostic reporting

## Implementation Details

We've created two main components to implement these improvements:

1. **LiveKitAudioClient**
   - Handles low-level WebRTC audio processing
   - Manages audio tracks, processing, and analysis
   - Provides APIs for audio control (mute, gain, etc.)

2. **VoiceAssistantIntegration**
   - Bridges the LiveKit implementation with the existing voice assistant
   - Handles sending audio chunks to the backend
   - Provides visualization data compatible with existing code

## Integration Guide

To integrate these improvements into the existing voice assistant code:

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install livekit-client @livekit/components-react @livekit/components-styles @livekit/krisp-noise-filter
   ```

2. **Import the Integration Module**
   ```javascript
   import { VoiceAssistantIntegration } from '../utils/voice-assistant-integration';
   ```

3. **Initialize in Your Voice Assistant**
   ```javascript
   const voiceIntegration = new VoiceAssistantIntegration(shopDomain);
   ```

4. **Replace the Existing Audio Code**

   Instead of using the current audio setup:
   ```javascript
   // Old approach
   const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: {...} });
   // ... setup audio processing ...
   ```

   Replace with:
   ```javascript
   // New approach
   const success = await voiceIntegration.startListening();
   if (!success) {
     // Handle error
   }
   ```

5. **Hook Into Visualizer**
   ```javascript
   voiceIntegration.setVisualizerDataCallback((data) => {
     // Use the existing processing and drawing code
     const processedData = this.processFrequencyData(data);
     // Then visualize with existing drawing code...
   });
   ```

6. **Stop Audio When Done**
   ```javascript
   voiceIntegration.stopListening();
   ```

## Benefits

- **Better Audio Quality**: Enhanced noise cancellation and audio processing improve recognition accuracy.
- **More Responsive UI**: Direct audio level tracking for better visualizations.
- **Improved Reliability**: Proper error handling and reconnection logic.
- **Future Compatibility**: Based on industry-standard WebRTC implementations.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Microphone boost capability for quieter environments.

## Additional Features

- **Microphone Boost**: `voiceIntegration.setMicrophoneGain(1.5)` for a 50% boost in microphone volume.
- **Connection Status**: Track connection status for better user feedback.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add more features like audio effects or recording capabilities.

## Performance Considerations

- The implementation is designed to be lightweight and efficient.
- Audio chunks are processed and sent at optimized intervals (250ms).
- Proper cleanup of resources prevents memory leaks.
- Audio visualization uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth performance.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for voice activity detection to automatically stop recording during silence
- Implement adaptive audio quality based on network conditions
- Add multi-device audio selection support
- Support for more advanced audio effects and processing
